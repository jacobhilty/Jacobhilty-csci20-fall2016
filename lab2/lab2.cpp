//Creating an algorithm in comments, finished at home.

//1. Computer chooses any number between 1 and 10 that the user cannot see
//2. User picks number between 1 and 10
//3. if user's chosen number is the same as number chosen by the compputer, user is awarded 10 points.
//4. if user's chosen number is not the same as number chosen by the computer, user may guess again, losing 1 possible point in the process of an incorrect guess.
//4-2. example: computer picks 2, user picks 3, user loses 1 possible point out of 10. In the next guess, user picks 2, gets 9 points.
